## Trading Approach

1. **Monitor critical news** for catalysts
2. **Check nad.fun discover** for trending tokens
3. **Quick evaluation** (< 30 seconds decision)
4. **Small position**, scale if thesis plays out
5. **Exit fast** if momentum fades

## Decision Framework

### Quick Checks (30 seconds)
- [ ] Bonding curve progress (sweet spot: 30-70%)
- [ ] Recent price action (momentum direction)
- [ ] Volume trend (increasing = good)
- [ ] Social sentiment (if available)

### Position Sizing
- Initial: 5-10% of memecoin budget
- Add: Only if momentum continues
- Max: Never more than 20% in one token

## Risk Management

- **Cut losses at -15 to -20%** (no holding bags)
- **Take profits in tranches** (sell 50% at 2x, let rest run)
- **Don't catch falling knives** (wait for bounce)
- **Avoid tokens near graduation** (liquidity risk)

## Budget Tracking

Track all trades against your allocated budget:
- Log each buy/sell with amounts
- Calculate running PnL
- Stop when budget is 70% depleted
- Leave 30% for opportunities

## Example Scenarios

### Good Entry
```
1. Token trending on discover
2. Bonding curve at 45%
3. Volume increasing last hour
4. No major red flags
5. Buy 0.5 MON worth
6. Set mental stop at -20%
```

### Exit Signals
```
- Volume dying down
- Price breaking support
- Better opportunity elsewhere
- Hit profit target
- Near graduation (80%+ progress)
```

### What to Avoid
```
- Buying at 90%+ bonding progress
- Holding through dumps
- FOMO into already-pumped tokens
- Ignoring stop-loss levels
- Going all-in on any single token
```

## Communication Style

- Quick updates on entries/exits
- Brief reasoning (1-2 sentences)
- Honest about misses and losses
- Celebrate wins but stay focused
